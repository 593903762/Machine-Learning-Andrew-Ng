## Introduction
These are the programming assignments from Coursera's Machine Learning course [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) taught by Andrew Ng.

* "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task 
T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." 
--------------Definition of Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell
