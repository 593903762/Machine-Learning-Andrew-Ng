## Introduction
These codes are the programming assignments from Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course  taught by Andrew Ng.
You also can watch the Stanford course [CS229](http://open.163.com/special/opencourse/machinelearning.html).
### Attentionï¼š
You can download the videos form [Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qZlQFoS).

* "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task 
T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." 
-------------- Definition of Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell

## How to start
### Dependencies
This project is coded in Matlab 2017b.
